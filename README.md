Instructions to Use Program:

- Run the program from main.py; you will be greeted with a visual interface
- A selection of buttons will be available for you to select from; the flavour text will guide the rest of your way

Real-World Applications of this Program:

- Allows users to view how single-displacement reactions actually operate (the metals only swap
  if their place on the activity series allows it). This is further enhanced by the fact that the
  individual element options in the "react" feature are listed in order of their reactivity, from
  lowest to highest. As a result, users are granted a live demonstration of the activity series' 
  influence, including what may happen when reactions do take place. 

- Users are able to view how one element group reacts with another. This is primarily enforced
  through flavour text that is shown during a reaction. It may indicate events such as flames 
  forming, ultraviolet light radiating, or sparks briefly appearing. All of these provide
  visual cues as to the reactivity of metals in a way that a textbook cannot provide.

- The compound inspector is especially helpful if users just want to inspect core properties of 
  commmonly referenced compounds in not only chemistry class, but also the real world. Enthalpies
  of formation, which are crucial for reactions involving heat changes, are displayed in the
  compound inspector, as well.

- The organic compound generator provides a suitable introduction to the concept of organic chemistry,
  successfully introducing the nomenclature that entails carbon-hydrogen molecules. Users will be 
  quick to realize that Alkenes, for example, have hydrogen counts that are double the carbon count.
  Prefixes like prop- (3) and oct- (8) will also correlate to the user's desired carbon chain length,
  further enforcing this theme of discovery and adventure that makes chemistry enjoyable in the first
  place.
